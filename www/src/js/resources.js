The CSV files facilitate the use of weather forecast for advanced control strategies, and provide an estimate of the output of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generated on-site.\n\nAs of today, CanMETEO’s files apply only to the Canadian territory and some neighbouring regions in the United States near the Canadian border.
